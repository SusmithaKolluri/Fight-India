        <h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
<h2>Q: Which mask should I use? Can I use a plain white mask, or the N95 mask?</h2>
<p><strong>Dr Leong: </strong>You should wear the blue and white surgical masks. The plain white masks are very thin compared to the blue and white surgical masks, which have 3 layers. The first outer layer is for general protection against spills. The second layer acts as a filter, and the inner layer is for your comfort when you wear the mask.</p>
<p>While the N95 mask works as a protection measure as well, I would discourage people from wearing it. This is because wearing the N95 mask can cause a lot of discomfort, and you may end up touching your face a lot as you adjust the mask, which should be avoided.</p>
<h2>Q: What is the right way to wear my mask?</h2>
<p><strong>Dr Leong:</strong> When wearing a mask, the blue side of the mask should be facing the outside, and the white side facing inside. There is no reason to wear it the other way round – doing so may trap things within the folds on the blue side.</p>
<p>Strap the sides over your ears first. Next, pull the top of the mask up to cover your nose, and ensure that the bottom of the mask covers below your chin. Thereafter, pinch the metal piece on your nose bridge to ensure the mask doesn’t slip from your face.</p>
<h2>Q: How long can I use my mask for?</h2>
<strong>Dr Leong:</strong> It depends. If your mask is wet, this means its filter component has been breached, and is no longer effective. Throw the mask away.
<p>However, if your mask is relatively clean and dry after use, you can take it off and put it into a sealable bag, to be reused again.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I would encourage you to discard it once it has been used. When disposing of your mask, make sure to wrap it up with a tissue paper or bag, to ensure that germs on the mask do not spread to other surfaces.</p>
<h2>Q: If I feel unwell, how safe is it to visit a clinic during this period?</h2>
<p><strong>Dr Leong:</strong> If you have to visit a clinic, make sure you wear a mask and wash your hands with soap and water. Avoid touching your face.</p>
<h2>Q: With medical science at its peak, why wasn’t a vaccine prepared earlier for a virus like this?</h2>
<p><strong>Dr Leong:</strong> If you look at the fecal matter of bats, there are thousands of coronavirus. No one knows which strain will go pandemic. Even if vaccines are prepared for all the coronavirus strains, the viruses can mutate easily and turn into a completely new virus, rendering the vaccines useless. It is also nearly impossible to predict how these viruses will mutate.</p>
